# FinalProjectAI - Abstract
The project looks at predicting the alcohol content of red wine using the UCI Wine Quality Dataset through Regression. The goal of the project was to determine which model is the most accurate at predicting through regression. After training and evaluating multiple models, CatBoost Regressor was the best performer with MAE of 0.3290, MSE of 0.2316, RMSE of 0.4782, R2 of 0.7950, RMSLE of 0.0408 and MAPE of 0.0312. These results showed that CatBoost Regressor can accurately predict the alcohol content of red wine and shows its ability to analyze the relationships in datasets.
